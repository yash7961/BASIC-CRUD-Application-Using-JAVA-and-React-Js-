 # Key Features:
   Employee Management:
   1. Add, edit, and delete employee information, including Firstname, Lastname, email, and other relevant data.
   2. View a list of all employees.

# Technology Stack:
  1. Front-End: React JS: A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
  2. Back-End: Spring Boot: A powerful Java framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
  3. Database: MySQL is a suitable database management system to store and manage employee data.

 # Getting Started:

=> Project Setup:

  1. Set up a React JS project for the front end and a Spring Boot project for the back end.
     
=>API Development:

  2. Develop Spring Boot REST APIs to handle employee data management operations (CRUD operations, leave management, payroll, etc.).
     
=>Front-End Development:

  3. Build React components to display employee data, forms for adding/editing information, and visualizations (leave calendars, reports).

=>API Integration:

  4. Integrate the Spring Boot back-end APIs into the React JS front-end using tools like Axios or Fetch API.
     
=>Data Management:

  5. Implement data validation and error handling on both the front and back end to ensure data integrity.
     
=>Deployment:

  6. Deploy the back-end application to a suitable server environment (e.g., Tomcat) and the front-end application to a web hosting platform.
